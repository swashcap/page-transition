# [Page Transition](http://swashcap.github.io/page-transition/)

A page-to-page transition test using Jekyll, CSS3 animations and some JavaScript. Loosely based on a [Codrops demo](http://tympanus.net/Development/PageTransitions/), colors scheme inspired from [Andrew Littmanâ€™s Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2049779-IMM-Brand-Stationery).
